	abstract = {Program calculation, being a programming technique that derives programs from specification by means of formula manipulation, is a challenging activity. It requires human insights and creativity, and needs systems to help human to focus on clever parts of the derivation by automating tedious ones and verifying correctness of transformations. Different from many existing systems, we show in this paper that Coq, a popular theorem prover, provides a cheap way to implement a powerful system to support program calculation, which has not been recognized so far. We design and implement a set of tactics for the Coq proof assistant to help the user to derive programs by program calculation and to write proofs in calculational form. The use of these tactics is demonstrated through program calculations in Coq based on the theory of lists.},

Tesson et al. have shown that Coq, a popular proof assistant, provides a cost-effective way to implement a powerful system for verifying correctness of program transformations, but their applications are limited to list functions in the Theory of Lists. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use Coq library to prove more advanced calculation rules in Coq for various recursion schemes, which capture recursive programs on an arbitrary algebraic datatype. We prove all the lemmas and theorems about recursion schemes in Coq including histomorphisms and futumorphisms proposed by Uustalu et al. Our library can be used to obtain certified runnable programs from their definitions written with recursion schemes in Coq scripts. We demonstrate a certified runnable program for the Fibonacci numbers and unbounded knapsack problem from their histomorphic definitions.},

We are concerned with the relationship between well-founded and recursive coalgebras for an endofunctor. For monomorphism preserving endofunctors on complete and well-powered categories every coalgebra has a well-founded part, and we provide a new, shorter proof that this is the coreflection in the category of all well-founded coalgebras. We present a new more general proof of Taylor's General Recursion Theorem that every well-founded coalgebra is recursive, and we study conditions which imply the converse. In addition, we present a new equivalent characterization of well-foundedness: a coalgebra is well-founded iff it admits a coalgebra-to-algebra morphism to the initial algebra.",

In particular, stream fusion is able to fuse zips, left folds and functions over nested lists, including list comprehensions. A distinguishing feature of the framework is its simplicity: by transforming list functions to expose their structure, intermediate values are eliminated by general purpose compiler optimisations.We have reimplemented the Haskell standard List library on top of our framework, providing stream fusion for Haskell lists. By allowing a wider range of functions to fuse, we see an increase in the number of occurrences of fusion in typical Haskell programs. We present benchmarks documenting time and space improvements.},

abstract = {Tree transformations are common in applications such as program rewriting in compilers. Using a series of simple transformations to build a more complex system can make the resulting software easier to understand, maintain, and reason about. Fusion strategies for combining such successive tree transformations promote this modularity, whilst mitigating the performance impact from increased numbers of tree traversals. However, it is important to ensure that fused transformations still perform their intended tasks. Existing approaches to fusing tree transformations tend to take an informal approach to soundness, or be too restrictive to consider the kind of transformations needed in a compiler. We use postconditions to define a more useful formal notion of successful fusion, namely postcondition-preserving fusion. We also present criteria that are sufficient to ensure postcondition-preservation and facilitate modular reasoning about the success of fusion.},

abstract = {Series of traversals of tree structures arise in numerous contexts: abstract syntax tree traversals in compiler passes, rendering traversals of the DOM in web browsers, kd-tree traversals in computational simulation codes. In each of these settings, a tree is traversed multiple times to compute various values and modify various portions of the tree. While it is relatively easy to write these traversals as separate small updates to the tree, for efficiency reasons, traversals are often manually fused to reduce the number of times that each portion of the tree is traversed: by performing multiple operations on the tree simultaneously, each node of the tree can be visited fewer times, increasing opportunities for optimization and decreasing cache pressure and other overheads. This fusion process is often done manually, requiring careful understanding of how each of traversals of the tree interact. This paper presents an automatic approach to traversal fusion: tree traversals can be written independently, and then our framework analyzes the dependences between the traversals to determine how they can be fused to reduce the number of visits to each node in the tree. A critical aspect of our framework is that it exploits two opportunities to increase the amount of fusion: i) it automatically integrates code motion, and ii) it supports partial fusion, where portions of one traversal can be fused with another, allowing for a reduction in node visits without requiring that two traversals be fully fused. We implement our framework in Clang, and show across several case studies that we can successfully fuse complex tree traversals, reducing the overall number of traversals and substantially improving locality and performance.},
