	abstract = {Program calculation, being a programming technique that derives programs from specification by means of formula manipulation, is a challenging activity. It requires human insights and creativity, and needs systems to help human to focus on clever parts of the derivation by automating tedious ones and verifying correctness of transformations. Different from many existing systems, we show in this paper that Coq, a popular theorem prover, provides a cheap way to implement a powerful system to support program calculation, which has not been recognized so far. We design and implement a set of tactics for the Coq proof assistant to help the user to derive programs by program calculation and to write proofs in calculational form. The use of these tactics is demonstrated through program calculations in Coq based on the theory of lists.},

Tesson et al. have shown that Coq, a popular proof assistant, provides a cost-effective way to implement a powerful system for verifying correctness of program transformations, but their applications are limited to list functions in the Theory of Lists. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use Coq library to prove more advanced calculation rules in Coq for various recursion schemes, which capture recursive programs on an arbitrary algebraic datatype. We prove all the lemmas and theorems about recursion schemes in Coq including histomorphisms and futumorphisms proposed by Uustalu et al. Our library can be used to obtain certified runnable programs from their definitions written with recursion schemes in Coq scripts. We demonstrate a certified runnable program for the Fibonacci numbers and unbounded knapsack problem from their histomorphic definitions.},

abstract = {This paper presents an automatic deforestation system, stream fusion, based on equational transformations, that fuses a wider range of functions than existing short-cut fusion systems. In particular, stream fusion is able to fuse zips, left folds and functions over nested lists, including list comprehensions. A distinguishing feature of the framework is its simplicity: by transforming list functions to expose their structure, intermediate values are eliminated by general purpose compiler optimisations.We have reimplemented the Haskell standard List library on top of our framework, providing stream fusion for Haskell lists. By allowing a wider range of functions to fuse, we see an increase in the number of occurrences of fusion in typical Haskell programs. We present benchmarks documenting time and space improvements.},
